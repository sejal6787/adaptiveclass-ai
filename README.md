# 🚀 AdaptiveClass AI — Adaptive Learning for College Classrooms

> **Core Philosophy**: *AI augments the teacher; it does not replace the teacher.*

AdaptiveClass AI is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed for college engineering classrooms (50–100+ students). It analyzes student performance at both individual and classroom levels, isolates acute concept gaps, equips professors with actionable instructional interventions, and provides students with dynamically personalized adaptive practice.

## 🌟 The Problem We Solve

In typical university engineering courses (e.g. 80 students in Data Structures), a professor receives an opaque class average like **64%**.

That single aggregate score cannot answer:
- *Which specific concepts are difficult for the majority of students?*
- *Which students are falling behind in recursion specifically?*
- *Who has mastered the curriculum and is ready for advanced algorithms?*
- *What targeted revision should the teacher conduct before next week's exam?*

### The AdaptiveClass AI Difference:
Instead of "Class Average: 64%", AdaptiveClass AI shows:
- **Arrays**: 82.0% ✓ (Strong)
- **Linked Lists**: 64.0% (Moderate)
- **Trees**: 41.0% ⚠ (Needs Attention)
- **Recursion**: 35.0% 🔴 (**Critical Gap** — 23 students below the 40% support threshold)
- **Graphs**: 58.0% (Needs Attention)
- **Sorting**: 75.0% ✓ (Proficient)

And gives the professor immediate, data-grounded recommendations:
> *"Recursion is currently the largest classroom learning gap at 35.0% class mastery. 23 students scored below the academic support threshold. Suggested action: Conduct a targeted recursion revision session covering base cases and stack behavior before introducing tree traversals."*

## ⚡ The "Wow" Demo (The Closed Feedback Loop)

The judges can experience the full adaptive cycle in under 3 minutes:

1. **Step 1 (Teacher View)**:
   - Login as **Prof. Vikram Sen** (`teacher@demo.com`).
   - Observe **Recursion at 35.0%** flagged with a **Critical Gap** alert.
   - See **23 students** needing support in the prominent **AI Classroom Insight** card.
   - Inspect **Aarav Sharma** in the *Students Needing Attention* table with **28% mastery** and a declining quiz trend (72% ➔ 64% ➔ 48%).

2. **Step 2 (Student View)**:
   - 1-click switch to **Aarav Sharma** (`student@demo.com`).
   - View personalized dashboard: **Recursion (28%)** flagged under *Needs Practice*.
   - See targeted practice recommendation: *"Recursion Fundamentals & Stack Tracing — ~15 min"*.

3. **Step 3 (Adaptive Practice)**:
   - Click **Start Adaptive Practice**.
   - Question 1 begins at **Beginner** difficulty (Base case purpose).
   - Answering correctly dynamically escalates the next question to **Intermediate**!
   - Answering incorrectly reinforces with supportive foundational problems.

4. **Step 4 (Dynamic Recalculation & Loop Closure)**:
   - Submit practice with 80% accuracy.
   - Aarav's new mastery is calculated dynamically from PostgreSQL:
     $$\text{New Mastery} = \text{round}(28.0 \times 0.35 + 80.0 \times 0.65) = 61.8\% \quad (+33.8\% \text{ gain})$$
   - Click **"View Updated Teacher Dashboard"**.
   - Teacher Dashboard re-queries PostgreSQL live:
     - **Class Recursion Average**: rose from **35.0% to 35.4%**!
     - **Students Needing Support**: dropped from **23 to 22**!

5. **Step 5 (Reset Demo Anytime)**:
   - Click **"Reset Demo"** in the top navigation bar to restore all 80 students, initial attempts, and baseline metrics instantly.

## 🚀 Quickstart & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 17

### 1. Database Setup
A dedicated PostgreSQL cluster script is provided in `scripts/`:
```cmd
# Initialize and start dedicated PostgreSQL instance on port 5433
d:\Zinnovatio 4.0\scripts\setup_pg.bat
d:\Zinnovatio 4.0\scripts\start_pg.bat
```
*(Or use any existing PostgreSQL instance and set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`)*

### 2. Backend Setup
```powershell
cd "d:\Zinnovatio 4.0\backend"

# Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (already installed in .venv)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run automated tests verifying PostgreSQL seed calibration & APIs
python -m pytest -v tests/

# Start FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
API Documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 3. Frontend Setup
```cmd
cd "d:\Zinnovatio 4.0\frontend"
npm install
npm run dev -- --port 5173
```
Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## 🛡️ Teacher Agency Principle

Every AI-generated insight strictly includes the standard disclaimer:
> *"AI-generated insights are recommendations. Teachers remain in control of instructional decisions."*

The system never dictates high-stakes academic judgments or labels students negatively; it highlights academic support needs grounded in measured concept data.
